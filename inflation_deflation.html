<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Hey Bud,</p>
<p>I made a web page for you to explain what inflation and deflation really are and to talk a little micro and macro economic reasons why they’re good or bad in different situations.</p>
<h3 id="terms-and-definitions">Terms and Definitions</h3>
<p>First off, lets start with some definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inflation: “In economics, inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy.”
<ul>
<li>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation">Wikipedia - Inflation</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deflation: “In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services.”
<ul>
<li>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation">Wikipedia - Deflation</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hyperinflation: “Hyperinflation indicates uncontrollable price increases over a defined period, typically measuring more than 50% [increase in price] per month.”
<ul>
<li>Source: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp">Investopedia - Hyperinflation</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stagflation: “Stagflation is the combination of high inflation, stagnant economic growth, and elevated unemployment.”
<ul>
<li>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation">Wikipedia - Stagflation</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Recession: “A recession is a significant, widespread, and prolonged downturn in economic activity. A common rule of thumb is that two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth indicate a recession.”
<ul>
<li>Source: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp">Investopedia - Recession</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Depression: “A depression is a severe and prolonged downturn in economic activity. A depression may be defined as an extreme recession that lasts three or more years or that leads to a decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) of at least 10% in a given year.”
<ul>
<li>Source: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depression.asp">Investopedia - Depression</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>On the face of it, as a consumer it seems like from those definitions alone <em>deflations</em> is what we want right? Prices are high, we want them to come back down. Maybe if we have run away Inflation, what we really need is some Deflation?</p>
<p>I’m going to attempt explain what these concepts really are, what causes them, why Deflation in combination with Inflation can lead to a worse situation for an economy to be in, called Stagflation. And ultimately why its not inflation that’s the problem, but rather its the failure of real wages to keep up with inflation over the past 50 years, causing widespread economic inequality on a scale not seen since the American and French Revolutions in the late 18th century.</p>
<h3 id="a-detour-into-micro-econ">A Detour into Micro Econ</h3>
<p>So prices change all the time in an economy outside of inflation and deflation. There are just market fluctuations. All of the sudden some product becomes very popular and there’s lots of demand so prices goes up. On the flip side, if there’s hardly anyone buying, low demand and high supply, price goes down etc.</p>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Supply-demand-equilibrium.svg/434px-Supply-demand-equilibrium.svg.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Wikipedia - Supply Demand Graph</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Remember, that middle point where the two lines intersect, that’s where we want to set the price for our good if we want to make the most money we can in the market.</p>
<p>So this is how prices are set in an economy. Its the “invisible hand of the market” to quote Adam Smith. Really its just self regulating* feedback system. And when I say “regulating” here its meant in the mechanical sense of the word, not the political.</p>
<p>Like literally when they used the word “regulating” they were talking about this thing! Not even a joke, 19th century they fucking loved this shit. Was high tech at the time and they used it as a metaphor for all sorts of feedback systems.</p>

<p>But it doesn’t mean we can trust these corporations to not pollute the air and poison the water. Or that we should stop inspecting meat and medicine and let the invisible hand of the market sort it all out. Just to make it clear what is meant by “regulation” here.</p>
<p>Anyways, so why do prices change to begin with in an economy? Well the supply and demand curves shift.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/content/images/2023/06/Supply-and-Demand-12.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>Supply/Demand Shifts - Economics Online</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And you know this already intuitively. When there’s a fall in demand with no change in supply, prices go down. When there’s a rise in supply with no change in demand, prices go down. And the same for both in reverse.</p>
<h2 id="root-causes-of-inflation">Root Causes of Inflation</h2>
<p>There’s lots of politics around the causes of inflation. However, in economics its generally agreed there are two main sources of inflation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Demand-Side Inflation</li>
</ol>
<p>Demand-side inflation occurs when aggregate demand (the total demand for goods and services in an economy) outpaces aggregate supply (the total supply of goods and services). This is often summarized as “too much money chasing too few goods.”</p>
<p>For example, in 2020 pandemic stimulus checks and low interest rates, lead to an increase in consumer spending, out pacing supply and so prices went up.</p>
<p>In order to try to regulate demand induced inflation, the Fed can set higher “Federal Funds Rates.” These rates refer to the maximum amount of interest allowed to be charged on loans between banks. We don’t have time to talk about all the details of how it works, but basically when the Fed lowers interest rates it makes borrowing cheaper encouraging spending and investment and when they raise interest rates it makes borrowing more expensive, discouraging spending / investing.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Supply-Side Inflation</li>
</ol>
<p>Supply-side inflation occurs when aggregate supply decreases or fails to keep up with demand, leading to higher prices. This is often caused by disruptions to the production or distribution of goods and services.</p>
<p>For example, in 1970 the OPEC oil embargo lead to a reduced supply of oil in the US. With no changes in demand, prices for oil (and therefore everything else in the economy) went up.</p>
<p>There’s not much governments can do to control supply side disruptions unfortunately.</p>
<h3 id="a-theory-of-money">A Theory of Money</h3>
<p>In macro economics there’s something called the <em>Quantity Theory of Money</em> which states:</p>
<pre><code>M * V = P * Y</code></pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>M = Money supply</p></li>
<li><p>V = Velocity of money (how quickly money circulates in the economy)</p></li>
<li><p>P = Price level (point where supply &amp; demand cross)</p></li>
<li><p>Y = Real output (goods and services produced)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So in this equation, an increase in <strong>M</strong> (money supply) leads to an increase in <strong>P</strong> (price). In other words, more money chasing the same amount of goods and services causes prices to rise. This is demand induced inflation.</p>
<p>But lets break this down a little more and see how this happens on a micro economic level.</p>
<h3 id="how-money-supply-affects-demand">How Money Supply Affects Demand</h3>
<p>When the supply of money in an economy increases people have more money to spend. So naturally they go out and buy stuff. In macro econ, this is known as an increase in the “velocity of capital” or “velocity of money”. Basically, its a measure of how quickly people and businesses are spending their income.</p>
<p>When there’s lots of money all the sudden injected into the economy demand increase because everyone goes out to spend their new cash.</p>
<p>In other words the demand curve shifts to the right:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg/220px-Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Demand Shift Right</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Meaning prices increase.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t the supply curve shift too, to keep up with demand?</p>
<p>Well remember production capacity doesn’t just change because there’s more money floating around in the economy. There aren’t magically more factories and workers all of the sudden just because we printed more money. Supply cannot match the increase in demand and so prices go up.</p>
<p>This has a knock on affect of course. As a business owner, if the cost of raw materials goes up, you’re going to charge your customers more. And thus inflation ripples through the entire economy.</p>
<p>So in short, what is demand induced inflation? Why does it happen?</p>
<p>Well with more money in the economy but the same amount of goods and services, buyers compete for limited resources, driving prices up. And as demand increases, sellers can charge higher prices because consumers are willing and able to pay more.</p>
<h2 id="when-is-inflation-goodbad">When is inflation Good/Bad?</h2>
<p>You will Not find a single sane economist under the sun who thinks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation">Hyper Inflation</a> is a good thing.</p>
<p>Economists typically define hyper inflation as an increase in price &gt;50% within a single month.</p>
<p><strong>!!!THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO THE ECONOMY OF THE UNITED STATES!!!</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a cool graph to show this history of inflation rates in the US over the past ~70 years.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/img/inflation_cpi.png" alt="" /><figcaption><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA">US Historic Inflation Rates - St Louis Federal Reserve</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see, post pandemic inflation rates were higher than normal 8% mid 2022. But that’s nothing compared to the peek 13% percent inflation rate in the late 70’s / early 80’s.</p>
<p>They measure inflation using something called the <em>Consumer Price Index</em> (CPI). Basically what they do is use something called a “market basket of goods” which includes things like the price of a loaf of bread, the price of the newest iPhone, etc. and they check how the price of these goods change over time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cpi/concepts.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics - Consumer Price Index</a></p>
<h3 id="why-is-a-little-inflation-considered-good">Why is a little inflation considered good?</h3>
<p>So clearly hyper inflation is bad. But why do they say a little bit of inflation is actually a good thing? Why not strive for an inflation rate of zero?</p>
<p>Well going back to what inflation is again, it is an increase in the money supply that leads to an increase in consumer spending and demand. In other words people are going out and they’re spending their money. They’re not sitting on it for a rainy day. Not only are they buying shit but they’re also building shit, creating new businesses, investing, and “stimulating the economy.” Jackin it off, if you would.</p>
<p>Also it means the value of debt goes down over time. If you took out a home loan 20 years ago for 100k, well 100k in 2005 dollars is worth about 160k in 2025 dollars. So that’s good for debt holders. Bad for debt lenders (aka banks).</p>
<p>Okay well in time periods where inflation is increasing, what if we used monitory policy to enforce some deflation? In other words, what if we raise interest rates to try to curb inflation?</p>
<p>Well, this is exactly what the Federal Reserve (The Fed) does. However, they do it very carefully. Because otherwise, if they raise interest rates too much it can slow economic growth down and create a situation called “Stagflation,” where interest rates are high, and inflation is high, but the economy still isn’t growing.</p>
<p>But okay, still why not shoot for 0% inflation?</p>
<p>Well the real danger of zero inflation is there’s no wiggle room for economic shock. Even a small upset could push the economy into deflation which can lead to recession and even depression.</p>

<h2 id="deflation-and-economic-recession-depression">Deflation and Economic Recession / Depression</h2>
<p>If inflation == economic expansion</p>
<p>Then deflation == economic contraction</p>
<p>In terms of micro economics, its the reverse of the demand shift we talked about earlier. This might seem on its face like a great thing, prices drop things become more affordable right?</p>
<p>However, an increasing rate in the fall of demand leads to a rather nasty positive feedback loop.</p>
<h3 id="a-downward-economic-spiral">A Downward Economic Spiral</h3>
<figure>
<img src="https://spureconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/deflationary-spiral.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Deflationary Spiral</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>First off, when people expect things to be cheaper in the future, they save their money. Why buy a TV today if you know it’ll be cheaper next month?</p>
<p>When people are saving their money and not spending it business scale back supply. As prices fall, businesses earn less revenue, even if they sell the same quantity of goods.</p>
<p>Lower profits mean less investment in the business. Who’s going to buy the stock of a company that hasn’t turned a profit in the past 6 quarters? (For some reason that economists still cannot fully explain, tech companies are somehow immune for this sort of investor response lols). But typically yeah, when profits are down investment is down.</p>
<p>So now businesses with lower revenues and less investment start cutting wages, freezing raises, laying off workers, and scaling back operations. This increases unemployment and spending contracts even further.</p>
<p>The real debt burden increases, leading to things like the absurd situation where the real value of debt used to repay loans is worth more than when the debt was incurred. This is NOT interest mind you! This is, say you took out a ZERO interest loan, deflation then happens, you now pay MORE real dollars (dollars adjusted for inflation/deflation) than the value of your original loan principal. Once again, that is without even considering any additional interest.</p>
<p>This leads to more people defaulting on their loans. Which makes bank more risk averse and so they issues fewer loans. Making it harder to get a loan to buy a house or start a business. If enough people start defaulting on their loans then we start getting into serious financial crisis territory.</p>
<p>Not only that, but also the typical leavers governments use to manipulate the economy cease to function in periods of deflation. The Fed can’t set negative interest rates, it only goes to 0%. So they essentially have no control at that point over inflation / deflation.</p>

<h3 id="liquidity-trap">Liquidity Trap</h3>
<p>Monetary policy ceases to function and you get into something called “the liquidity trap” where central banks are injecting cash into the economy, trying to stimulate investment and spending, but people are just hording it cause prices keep going down. So the Fed’s just poking the economy with a stick but its not moving.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/img/liquidity-trap.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>liquidity trap meme</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now with rising deflation, increasing unemployment and layoffs, reduced spending, its harder to get a loan, harder to start a business and get investment, the Fed also can’t do anything stimulate spending, now we’re really starting to get into some trouble here. We call this situation economic recession.</p>
<p>You and I have lived through this in 2008. I don’t know how much you remember from that time but we had PhDs and MDs working at MickyDee’s. That sorta thing is typically a sign that your economy is fucked!</p>
<p>If left unchecked this can lead to economic depression. This is what happened in 1929 with <em>The Great Depression</em>. Prices fell by nearly 30% between 1929 and 1933. The real value of debt soared, leading to widespread defaults and bank failures. And unemployment reached as high as 25%. Imagine that, a quarter of the workforce, willing and able work, and yet through No fault of their own completely unable to find work.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-problem-is-wage-stagnation-not-inflation">The Real Problem is Wage Stagnation, Not Inflation!</h2>
<p>First again, lets define some more terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Real Wages: Wages adjusted for inflation, reflecting the actual purchasing power of workers’ earnings.</p></li>
<li><p>Productivity: This measures how much output (goods and services) is produced per hour of work.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For much of the 20th century, workers real wages and productivity grew in tandem. As workers became more productive (due to better technology, education, and infrastructure), they were compensated with higher wages. This created a virtuous cycle of rising incomes, increased consumer spending, and economic growth.</p>

<p>So that might lead you to ask; If workers have been more productive and real wages haven’t change, where’s that excess money going?</p>
<p>While the average workers real wages have stagnated, wages for the top 10% of workers (especially the top 1%) have grown substantially.</p>
<p>According to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), between 1979 and 2019 the average income of the top 1% increased by 160%, after adjusting for inflation.</p>

<p>The top 1% of the US population now owns more wealth than the bottom 90% of Americans combined. For some context, in the 1970s, the top 1% held about 23% of total wealth, while the bottom 90% held 35%.</p>
<p>The top 1% of Americans hold 32.3% of total wealth, while the bottom 50% hold just 2.6%.</p>
<p>I’ll finish with this video about peoples perception of economic inequality vs actual economic inequality. But in short, it not inflation alone that’s the problem. Instead its the fact that your wages have not kept up with inflation despite the fact that your productivity has. In other words, they’re robbing us all blind.</p>
