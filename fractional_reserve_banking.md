# Fractional Reserve Banking & The Federal Reserve

## Part 1. What is Fractional Reserve Banking?

First and foremost, private banks are businesses. They are in it to make a
profit and nothing much else matters to them.

Their business model is pretty simple. They take in deposits from customers and
in exchange for keeping your money safe they use that money to issue loans to
other customers. They then charge interest on those loans at a rate which will
ensure they're going to make a profit, despite (normal) currency fluctuations
and risks of default. 

Private banks are required by law to keep a certain percentage of money in
reserves at all time to safeguard against a run on the bank, and to help
control inflation by regulating the money supply. This is where the "fraction"
in Fractional Reserve Banking comes from.

All of this lending and depositing has an interesting economic effect which
economists describe as "expanding the money supply." Keep in mind they're not
minting new currency, only the treasury does that. They're simply creating new
money out of "nothing."

This is the point at which a lot of people go, "well that sounds like a
duplication glitch and it should probably be illegal." But the truth is, its
just simple accounting and the same rules hold true for any business that has
assets (aka guap) and liabilities (aka debts).

### The Money Multiplier Effect

In accounting they use something called a T chart to show assets vs
liabilities.

```
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
|   Assets (What You Own)     |  Liabilities (What You Owe) |
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Cash:               $5,000  | Credit Card Debt:   $2,000  |
| Savings:           $10,000  | Student Loan:      $15,000  |
| Car (Value):       $12,000  | Mortgage:         $150,000  |
| Investments:        $8,000  | Car Loan:           $5,000  |
| Home (Value):     $250,000  | Medical Bills:      $1,500  |
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Total Assets      $285,000  | Total Liabilities $173,500  |
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities =  $111,500  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
```

We can do this for a bank too in order to better understand the [_"Money
Multiplier Effect"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier) banks have
on the marco-economy.

So let's say we start a brand new bank just open for business. Our first
customer comes along and deposits $100 dollars into their brand new account.
Our T chart for the bank would then look like this.

```
   Assets   | Liablities
------------+------------
    $100    |   $100
```

The bank now has $100 dollars in assets (aka money in the vault), but it also
has an obligation to give you back your $100 dollars should you come and ask
for it.

Now let's say a second customer (Bob) comes into our new bank and is seeking a
loan. They need $50 dollars in cash as a loan. The bank is required by law to
keep 20% of its deposits in reserves and is free to loan the rest. So our new T
chart would look like this:

```
              Assets   | Liablities
           ------------+------------
Required Reserves $20  |   $100  Original Deposit
Loan to Bob       $50  |
Excess Reserves   $30  |  
```

Now let's at the effect that loan just had on the larger economy.

So first off, we can define the total supply of money in the economy (aka M1)
with the following equation:

```
Money Supply (M1) = Total Cash in Circulation + Total Cash in Deposits
```

So when we look at what just happened with our loan we can see the money
multiplier effect in action.

Let's say before we opened our bank, the total amount of money in the local
town's economy was $1000 dollars, with ~40% of it tied up in deposits at other
banks. (Its a very small, broke, and frugal town).

```
Total Money Supply $1000 = $600 (circulating) + $400 (deposits)
```

Now notice what happens to the money supply after we open our bank, take a
deposit, and issue our first loan. So first we take away -$100 from money in
circulation, and add +$100 to deposits (our first customers deposit). Then we
gave $50 to Bob, increasing the money in circulation.

```
Total Money Supply $1050 = $550 (circulating) + $500 (deposits)
```

It's increased by $50 dollars! In other words, $50 dollars has just been
created out of nothing, with no change in the underlying amount of actual
currency that exists in the economy (aka M0).

However, our new bank is not done yet! We still have $30 more dollars in Excess
Reserves we could loan out again to create even more money in the economy.

In order to figure out the Maximum amount of money that could be created in
this manner, we can calculate the "Money Multiplier" with the following
equation.

```
MM: Money Mulitplier
rr: Returns Ratio

MM = 1 / rr
```

So with our reserve ratio of %20, we can see we have a money multiplier of
five: `5 = 1 / 0.2`. In other word, in a perfect world with no _leakage_, with
a reserve ratio of .2, every 1 dollar deposited in the bank can create $5 worth
of value.

In the real world the effects are even more extreme than our little example
above because real banks don't really give out cash loans. Instead, the money
from the loan is deposited into the customer's checking account, meaning the
bank can then use the deposit from the loan it just issued.

### Where Does the New Wealth Come From?

So in the back of your mind you might still have the question: "Isn't this just
one big pyramid scheme? Where is this new value that's created coming from?
Isn't this just cleaver accounting? Surely, somehow somewhere someone is
cheating..."

Well, in order to answer those questions we have to discuss risk and what
"value" means in an economic context.

I kinda of lied earlier when I said value was created out of nothing by issuing
loans. Instead, value is create in the economy because loans are really an
investment made by a bank in some private individual or some company.

When bank's issue loans they're taking on risk that they person or venture
they're investing in might default and be unable to repay them. And generally
they won't issue a loan unless they're pretty sure they're going to make their
money back.

And its not like these loans just sit there and do nothing in the economy.
These are loans to start businesses, to expand operations, to buy homes and
cars, and pay for education, etc. In other words they stimulate the economy and
are a key part in providing the capital necessary to facilitate economic
growth.

This is where the value comes from. What that Money Multiplier dollar value
represents is all of the new stuff and services that exists and gets created in
the world when a person spends the money from their loan.

This is also the main reason why during the 2008 finical crisis several big
banks were considered "Too Big To Fail". In other words, the economic effects
of allowing these giant banks to go under would have been worse for the entire
economy, than the cost of bailing them out. Too many people's pensions and
investments and businesses and livelihoods were wrapped up in these giants and
recovering from a total finical sector wipeout would have taken longer and cost
far more in the long run (or so the conventional wisdom goes).

## Part 2. The Federal Reserve System

### A Brief History Lesson

Before we talk about the modern day federal reserve system, let's go back in
time to the 1790's to discuss a debate at the center of creation of the first
US central bank which still reverberates through our politics to this day.

Immediately following the revolutionary war, the new nation was dealing with
some pretty big problems. First off, each state had war debts that needed
repaid, if the new nation was ever going to establish credit (both within the
country and overseas). Second, several states were still minting their own fiat
currencies which were not backed by the treasury. Third, the country needed to
raise money to fund the new government.

To resolve these problems, then secretary of the treasury Alexander Hamilton
proposed the creation of _The First Bank of The United States_. Unlike the Bank
of England, this new bank would be a private non-governmental institution that
would issue credit to the new nation and private interests alike for economic
development. It was supposed to exists as a stop gap, lending short term loans
to the federal government until it could get back on its feet.

Hamilton's idea for a central bank faced opposition from the start. Then
Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and James Madison both opposed the new bank
claiming it violated the Constitution, which specifically stated that Congress
was to regulate weights and measures and issue coined money (rather than mint
and bills of credit). 

They also argued that at best the new central bank would benefit wealthy
merchants and investors northern cities over the common folk in more rural and
agrarian areas and at worse it would become a vehicle for corruption.
Nonetheless, on February 25, 1791 President George Washington signed the bill
into law, declaring that he was hesitant to sign the "bank bill." 

![First Bank of The United States](static/img/first-bank-of-the-united-states.jpg)

The bank was originally created with a twenty year charter and closed in 1811
when congress sold their remaining shares in the bank to raise money. Shortly
after, then President Thomas Jefferson was forced to reinstate the bank as "The
Second Bank of The United States" in response to debts incurred during The War
of 1812.

### Our Modern Monetary System

Today The Federal Reserve is no longer just a single bank. Instead, in The US
there are 12 regional banks overseen by a board of governors.

![The Federal Reserve System](static/img/fed-map.png)

These governors take their pointers from the chair of the board of the Federal
Reserve (currently Jerome Powell) who is responsible for setting all monetary
policy for the nation.

In government, there's two types of policy relating to money.

1. Fiscal Policy - Collecting Taxes & Printing Currency
2. Monetary Policy - Setting Interest Rates & Controlling Reserve Ratio

Congress and the President are responsible for setting Fiscal Policy. But all
control over monetary policy ultimately is up to The Fed.

In the US, The Fed has a duel mandate to:

1. Promote Maximum Employment (ie. The highest level of employment the economy can sustain without generating unwelcome inflation)
2. Promote Price Stability (aka Shoot for a target of 2% annual inflation on average)

And there are three main tools he fed has to accomplish this:

1. Setting interest rates
2. Setting the reserve ratio
3. Buying & selling government bonds (and other securities)

We already talked about last time how The Fed can cut interest rates to try to
curb inflation. So wont spend any more time on that here. But the other leavers
are interesting too so we'll discuss them briefly.

In March of 2020 The Fed slashed the reserve ratio to Zero and haven't changed
it since. What that means is that right now (August 2025), by law banks are Not
required to keep any percentage of deposits in their vaults.

The idea here was to encourage lending during the pandemic. However, its still
set at zero and this is a risky position to be in because it means if enough
people try to withdrawn their cash at the same time, there could be a run on
the banks. Financial lobbying groups will try to convince you this is fine and
banks are keeping their own reserves anyways. Press (X) to doubt on that one.

Last thing The Fed can do besides adjust rates is they also buy and sell
government bonds (aka Fed Backed Securities). A bond is kinda like a loan in
reverse. Its an IOU from uncle Sam promising to pay you back with interest at
some point in the future.

When inflation is high and The Fed is trying to slow economic activity and
cause contraction, The Fed sells bonds to commercial banks and other financial
institutions. This has the effect of sucking the money up out of the banking
system, causing interest rates on loans to increase, making borrowing more
expensive, and slowing economic activity.

Likewise, when the economy is slow and stagnant, The Fed will buy back up those
bonds it issued, increasing the money supply, injecting cash into the economy,
causing a drop in interest rates, making borrowing cheaper.

The main idea with selling and buying bonds is to try to influence interest
rates by expanding or contracting the money supply.

## Part 3. Fact Vs Fiction

![Conspiracy Theories](static/img/fedspiracy.png)

Okay for this last part I want to tackle some of these common myths and
conspiracies you tend to hear about The Fed and Fractional Reserve Banking.
And finally finish off by addressing some of the real systemic problems that
exist with these financial systems. As always, you don't need to endorse fringe
conspiracy theories, the real world is sad enough all on its own. 

### Debunking Common Conspiracies

#### Myth 1: "The Federal Reserve is a Private Bank Owned by Secret Elites"

One of the most persistent conspiracy theories is that the Federal Reserve is a
privately owned entity controlled by a shadowy group of bankers. While it’s
true that the Fed has a unique structure, with regional Federal Reserve Banks
technically structured as private corporations, it's misleading to call it a
"private" institution. 

The Fed's Board of Governors is a government agency whose members are appointed
by the President and confirmed by Congress. Its policies are publicly
disclosed, and its profits (after operational costs) are handed over to the
U.S. Treasury (about $100 billion annually in recent years.)

The Fed's independence is designed to shield monetary policy from short-term
political pressure, not to hide some secret financial coup. The real concern
shouldn't be about secret ownership but rather about how much influence Wall
Street banks have over its policies in the open. A legitimate criticism, but
far from a hidden conspiracy.  

#### Myth 2: "Fractional Reserve Banking is a Scam / Ponzi Scheme"

Some critics claim that fractional reserve banking is inherently fraudulent
because banks "create money out of nothing" while still demanding repayment on
loans.

In reality, as we discussed earlier, this system is just how modern economies
function. Banks take deposits, keep a fraction in reserve (as required by
regulators), and lend out the rest. This lending fuels economic growth by
allowing businesses to expand, people to buy homes, and innovation to flourish. 

The system isn't a Ponzi scheme because banks don't promise impossible returns.
They just facilitate borrowing and lending, with risks managed by capital
requirements and oversight. 

The real danger isn't fractional reserve banking itself, but when banks take
excessive risks (like in 2008) or when regulators fail to enforce prudent
lending standards.

#### Myth 3: "Gold-Backed Money Would Solve Everything"

[Vox - The Case Against the Gold Standard](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/16/5900297/case-against-gold-standard)

There are so many freaking conspiracies related to the gold standard. It's
gotta be top up there with the moon landing and JFK assassination in terms of
fucking idiotic bullshit made up about it.

Primary argument is that if we were still on the gold standard it would prevent
inflation, stop government overreach, and stabilize the economy. 

While gold-backed money might sound appealing (it feels "real" and is
impossible to just print more of it), history shows it has major flaws. 

The primary problem is the gold standard restricts the money supply, meaning
governments can't easily respond to economic crises. Which worsening recessions
and depressions (like in the 1930s). It also ties money to a finite resource,
which can lead to deflation (falling prices), making debts harder to repay.

Modern economies need flexible monetary policy to manage recessions, smooth out
financial shocks, and maintain employment.

The real debate shouldn't be about gold vs. fiat money, but about how to ensure
responsible monetary policy without extreme swings in inflation or
unemployment.

### The Real Harms of Banking & Fed Policies

![Soup Kitchen Lines - 1931 The Great Depression - Getty Images](static/img/great-depression.jpg)

#### 1. Boom-Bust Cycles & Financial Crises

One of the biggest flaws in our modern global financial system is its tendency
to create boom-and-bust cycles. Banks lend too freely, fueled by low interest
rates and lax regulations. When they do this they inflate asset bubbles (like
housing in 2008 or tech stocks in 2000). Those bubbles then burst and ordinary
people suffer through job losses, foreclosures, and wiped-out savings.

This isn't due to some secret banking cabal, but to a mix of greed, poor risk
management, and regulatory failures. The Fed can sometimes worsen these cycles
by keeping rates too low for too long, encouraging reckless borrowing.

The real solution isn't abolishing banks but enforcing smarter regulations to
curb excessive risk-taking.

#### 2. Inequality from Easy Money Policies

Since the 2008 financial crisis, central banks like the Fed have relied heavily
on low interest rates and quantitative easing (QE) to stimulate the economy.

During the 2008 financial crisis, many financial institutions held significant
amounts of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and other related assets that
became difficult to value and sell due to the housing market collapse.

These assets were deemed "toxic" because their uncertain value threatened the
solvency of the institutions holding them, potentially freezing the credit
markets and worsening the economic downturn.

In response, the Federal Reserve launched several rounds of QE, which included
purchasing large quantities of these distressed mortgage-backed securities.

While these policies helped prevent a depression, they also had the side effect
of skyrocketing wealth inequality. 

Ultra-low rates made borrowing cheap for corporations and the wealthy,
inflating stock and real estate prices. Since the richest 10% own most
financial assets, they benefited enormously, while wage growth for average
workers stagnated.

The Fed didn't do this deliberately, but its policies exposed a harsh reality:
when money is cheap (aka when its easy to get loans with low interest rates),
those who already own assets get richer, while those who don't fall further
behind.

#### 3. Inflation Mismanagement

A central bank's most critical job is keeping inflation stable. However,
getting it wrong can have devastating consequences. 

If the Fed prints too much money (as in the 1970s) or reacts too slowly (like
in 2021-2022), inflation erodes purchasing power, hurting savers and
fixed-income earners (aka old people on Social Security) the most. 

On the flip side, if the Fed raises rates too aggressively to fight inflation,
it can trigger a recession. The challenge is that the Fed often has to make
these calls with incomplete data, leading to mistakes that impact everyone. 

The real risk isn't some secret inflation plot, but the difficulty of balancing
growth and price stability in a complex macro economy.

#### 4. "Too Big to Fail" Moral Hazard

![Too Big to Fail](static/img/too-big-to-fail.png)

After the 2008 crisis, the government bailed out major banks, arguing that
their collapse would wreck the economy. This created a so called "moral hazard"
(the idea that banks will take riskier bets knowing they'll be rescued if
things go wrong).

While reforms like Dodd-Frank tried to address this, the problem persists:
megabanks are still so interconnected that their failure could trigger chaos.

This isn't a conspiracy. It's a structural flaw where profits are privatized,
but losses are socialized. The real solution isn't ending the Fed but rather
breaking up or strictly regulating banks that are "too big to fail" so they
can't hold the economy hostage.

### Final Thoughts

The Federal Reserve and fractional reserve banking aren't perfect. They have
real flaws that can harm everyday people. But the problems come from bad
policy, regulatory capture, and mismanagement. Not shadowy elites running a
secret financial scam.

The best way to protect the economy isn't by embracing conspiracy theories, but
by demanding transparency, smarter regulations, and a Fed that works for Main
Street, not just Wall Street.
