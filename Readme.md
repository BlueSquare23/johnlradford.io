# John's Personal Home Page

This repository contains the files for my personal website,

https://johnlradford.io/

## Overview / Site Layout

The site is mainly one page with an old WordPress site down in the blog
directory (Not tracked).

On the site you'll find my bio, my resume, my public PGP key, links to my
github, information about my FTP site, a hit counter, a small portfolio of
sample projects I've worked on, and a guestbook.
