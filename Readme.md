# John's Personal Home Page

This repository contains the files for my personal website,

https://johnlradford.io/

## Overview / Site Layout

The site is mainly a single hand-written HTML page with an old wp site down in
the blog directory (Not tracked).

On the site you'll find my bio, my resume, my public PGP key, links to my
github, information about my FTP site, a hit counter, a small portfolio of
sample projects I've worked on, and a guestbook.
