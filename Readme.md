This repository contains the files for my personal website,

## Structure, Site Map

Currently there's not too much to the site. Just some HTML file and an old
WordPress blog (Not tracked).

```
  |-- Readme.md
  |-- blog/
  |-- cgi-bin/
  |-- favicon.ico
  |-- hrbadge.js
  |-- index.html
  |-- resume.html
  |-- resume.pdf
  |-- resume.tex
  `-- static/
      |-- css/
      |   `-- main.css
      `-- img/
```

Its mainly a one page site with links to my resume, github, and a bunch of
sample projects I've worked on.
