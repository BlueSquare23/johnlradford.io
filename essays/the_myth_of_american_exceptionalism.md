# Overview

Hey bud, just a heads up this one's going to be kinda sad.

Before we begin, let me say I don't hate America. I'm not trying to convince
you to hate America. America is and has always been an idea, a concept, a
dream, more than a reality. So what would that even mean to hate the concept of
America?

No, instead what I want to talk about today is dispelling the myth that America
is "the greatest country on Earth!" How we're going to do it is we're just
going to talk about facts and history.

See you and I went to the same schools, had the same history classes (shout out
Mr. O!). But as I'm sure you're very aware the traditional story we're told
about the founding and history of this country is a myth.

Likewise, so are many of the stories we're told about its values and greatest
beliefs.

## Part 1. American Exceptionalism By the Numbers 

By definition, to be _"exceptional"_ is to be out of the ordinary.

In stats we use a normal curve to describe how ordinary/exceptional something
is.

![Normal Distribution Curve](https://rotel.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/77/2024/07/Normal-Distribution-deviations.png)

### Quality of Life Metrics

In political science they use what are called "Quality of Life" measures to
assess the health and well being of citizen in a given country. These include
things like, life expectancy, literacy rates, GDP per capita, real wage growth,
etc.

So just according to the numbers, how does America stack up against the rest of
the world?

### Literacy

To look at pure country ranking is misleading because literacy is a spectrum.
Its not a binary thing and is more complicated than simply can or cannot read. 

Also lots of countries lie about their overall literacy rates. On paper the US
has a 99% literacy rate, however that's misleading at best and an outright lie
at worse.

What's more important is the level people read at. This is tracked using a
standardized assessment developed by the _"Program for the International
Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC)"_. 

Here's some info I could find on actual US literacy rates.

[U.S. Department of Education NCES - July 2019](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019179/index.asp)

So how does this compare to other wealthy industrialized nations? 

Well I found this cool site that list all of these _Program for the
International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC)_ scores:

```{=html}
<iframe width='550' height='620' frameBorder='0' src='https://www.compareyourcountry.org/adult-skills?lg=en&cr=oecd&page=0'></iframe>
```

Doesn't appear to be very exceptional to me. Looks kinda below average
actually, hrmmm...

### Infant Mortality

Well according the _CIA World Factbook_, the US is ranked 173rd out of 227
countries. Now in terms of infant mortality, higher ranking means less dead
babies. So no.1 is Afghanistan where on avg 100 / 1000 infants will die during
child birth. In the US that number is 5.1 / 1000 (with that number jumping to
10/1000 for African American women).

But still there are 50 countries on earth that do a better job taking care of
their babies than we do.

[CIA World Factbook - cia.gov](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/infant-mortality-rate/country-comparison/)

[Infant Health and Mortality and Black/African Americans - hhs.gov](https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/infant-health-and-mortality-and-blackafrican-americans)

> Spending

[US Has Highest Infant... - ajmc.com](https://www.ajmc.com/view/us-has-highest-infant-maternal-mortality-rates-despite-the-most-health-care-spending)

### Cost of Living

Cost of living is ranked by something called the "Cost of Living Index."

> What Is a Cost of Living Index? 
>
> Cost of living data includes the expenses incurred for food, shelter,
> transportation, energy, clothing, education, healthcare, childcare, and
> entertainment.
>
> A cost of living index tracks how much basic expenses for these categories
> rise over time and in different regions. It can demonstrate how need-based
> expenses vary from one area to another. 

- [Cost of Living Index - investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100214/how-cost-living-index-calculated.asp)

What matters is a lower Cost of Living Index (COLI) number is better.

![US Cost of Living Map - numbeo.com](/static/img/us-cost-of-living.png)

- [Cost of Living Index by Country 2025 Mid-Year - numbeo.com](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp)

Now we have to keep in mind that the US is a developed nation and generally
speaking, developed nations have a higher cost of living.

However, surprise surprise, the US still ranks worse than Germany, France,
Japan, UK, Canada, Australia, etc.

outcomes right?

### Gun Violence

- [Facts & Stats: How Much The U.S. Stands Out Globally](https://www.jacksoncountycombat.com/1112/Facts-Stats-How-Much-The-US-Stands-Out-G)

And firearms are now the leading cause of death for people age 1-19 in the US.
More than car crashes or cancer or anything else.

### These Are Choices

</div>

Now I'd disagree on one thing with Carl Sagan, "we" didn't do anything. I don't
believe the people have popular control over the government, so blaming
everyone collectively is not useful. Like "oh well guess we should all care
more," no that's not exactly the problem.

The problem is there are those who benefit from suffering through private
ownership. They have no incentive to change the status quo.

Instead we need to establish real popular control over the government with
robust mechanisms to keep private interests at bay.

## Part 2. History vs American Moral Superiority

Now you might be thinking;

"Well okay, maybe we're not the best at QoL metrics. Sure there's lots of
European and Asian countries that are beating us at reading, breading, and
feeding their populations. But they don't have the history and grandeur of the
United States! After all we're the world first and oldest Democracy. We're a
nation of immigrants with liberty, freedom, and justice for all! Right?"

### American Genocides, War Crimes, & Miscellaneous Atrocities

Well we don't have to go into every atrocity committed in the name of the
United States. So here are some of the hightlights!

![Saigon Execution by Eddie Adams, Associated Press](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_05/2088766/ap_746400184512.jpg)

### This is a Pattern, Not an Exception!

Just look at the history of South America ever since the establishment of the
[Monroe Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine).

![US Involvement in Latin America](/static/img/us_involvement_latin_america.jpg)

Country after country the US has backed the overthrow of popularly elected
leaders in favor of capitalist backed cronies to protect American business
interests.

<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJLA2_Ho7X0?t=1796" title="Project Cybersyn &amp; The CIA Coup in Chile (Full Documentary by Plastic Pills)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

The above list is not comprehensive but illustrative. It reveals that many of
America's gravest moral failures were not accidents or the work of "a few bad
apples," but were often official policy, enabled by law, fueled by racism or
ideological fervor, and defended by appeals to necessity or superiority.

</div>

I sent this to my buddy Zach too and here's what he had to say about it.

> These aren't actions done just to be evil for the hell of it. The extreme
> exploitation of Black people through slavery and Manifest Destiny and the
> ethnic cleansing of Native Americans are what allowed the owning class to
> prosper as much as it did. 
> 
> And that's not all in the past. We went to war in the Middle East for oil and
> are ramping things up with Venezuela now that we've discovered they have the
> largest oil reserves in the world.

- Zach Scheider

And sure enough history repeats itself:

### Our Rights and Freedoms

"Okay okay, but that's all foreign policy stuff and history. What makes America
great today is our fundamental rights and liberties! We got ourselves a
constitution!"

Well lets examine those rights and see how they hold up to scrutiny.

#### Freedom of Speech & The Right to A Fair Trial

Sure you've got Freedom of Speech, till they want to shut you up. Take for
example the case of Steven Donziger.

Steven Donziger is an environmental rights lawyer. In the 90's he won a $9.5
billion ($13 billion in 2024 dollars) lawsuit against Chevron on behalf of over
30,000 farmers and Indigenous people who suffered damages and health problems
resulting from oil spills.

As a result, In 2011, Chevron filed a RICO (anti-corruption) suit against
Steven Donziger and disbarred him. If you're not familiar with RICO, that's
typically what they hit mobsters with. They then held him under house arrest
for criminal contempt of court from 2019-2021, a combined total of 993 days
under house arrest.

He was convicted by a team of PRIVATE PROSECUTORS for the first time in US
history. That's right, the judge allowed Chevron's lawyers to run the
prosecution, not a prosecutor from the state. The judge was a Chevron investor
and the law firm hired by Chevron for the case (Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher) was
paid $30 million dollars from Chevron. There was no jury.

He was sued for $60 billion dollars, the most of any individual in this history
of the United States. They sentenced him to 4x times the maximum sentence for
contempt of court, 60 days. He served 45 days before an appeals court let him
go.

Human rights campaigners called Chevron's actions an example of a strategic
lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP).

## Part 3. American Culture

Now you might say:

"Well okay, but that's the Government, not the people. Sure American business
and political elites are conspiring to topple world governments and engineer
human tragedies. But that's not you and me doing any of that. What makes
America really number 1 is our culture!"

So lets discuss that.

### A Culture Eating Its Own Tail

We're all aware of the sort of paradox of America's multi-cultural identity.
The best culture in the world, yet its just a recycling of every other culture.

The best food in the world! Except what's the most American food? A hotdog, a
_hamburg_er, _french_ fries. 

Well how about movies and entertainment?

You might notice not a single one of those is an original property or idea. The
only one on the list that's not explicitly a sequel is a movie based on a
plastic toy and sponsored by Matel. Yet they continue to make billions, so why
would they ever stop making them?

I wrote a custom perl script just to sort that data btw. All for you buddy!

### The Death of The American Dream

Well fine okay sure all of our media has become commercialized, generalized,
and made bland soulless. But at least we still have the American Dream right?

Between 1970 and today, home prices have increased well over 1000% in some
areas. In 1970 the median home prices was around $27,000. Today its $500,000! 

[St Louis Fed - stlouisfed.org](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ASPUS)

And the price to income ratio for houses continues to get worse.

## Conclusion

### So What the Fuck is America Actually?

The United States of America is an empire and an oligarchy. 

What you'll hear all over the news media is that with the rise of Trump, The US
has taken a hard right turn into fascism. And while its true that Trump is a
prototypical fascist, checking every single box perfectly, this administration
is simply a continuation of trends that have deep roots in American history.

The truth is, it has always been the case that the American elite run the show
without any regard for the interests of the majority.

### The Pipeline from Patriotism into Nationalism

But why does any of this matter. Can't we just pretend we live in the best
country on earth even if the reality is a bit less glamorous. What's the harm
in having some national pride?

What an ironically prevalent sentiment to be found in a nation so caught up on
"individuality."

> Patriotism is a healthy love and devotion to one's country, focused on its
> ideals and working for its betterment, even with criticism; while nationalism
> is an extreme, often exclusionary belief in national superiority,
> prioritizing one nation's interests above others, fostering division, and
> potentially leading to animosity or conflict. 

[Nationalism vs. Patriotism: What’s the Difference? - britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nationalism-vs-Patriotism-Whats-the-Difference)

A statement like; "America is the best country on Earth!" might seem patriotic,
but it is in fact nationalistic.

Same goes for statements like "Germany is for the Germans" or "America First."

You might remember the "America First Committee" (AFC) infamously held a Nazi
rally in Madison Square Garden in 1939.

### Immigration & Fascism

Remember most immigration violations, like overstaying a visa or being in the
US without authorization, are civil offenses, not criminal.

An appeal to Krause:

More people have died in ICE detention this past year under Trump, than the
previous four years under Biden combined.

## Final Thoughts

Its tempting to come away from this all feeling indifferent.

"So what we're still the greatest country in the world!" 🦅🇺🇸

- Krause, probably

Whether that comes from the issues being too big to tackle and we feel like as
individuals we have little agency, or because "its always been that way" and
"change is messy."

But this feeling of not only indifference, but embracing one's own indifference
toward the _externalities_ of the system as long as we ourselves continue to
benefit from it, is something I've best heard described as _"Zen Fascism"_.

This is the part where I could make some cliche references to "the good parts"
of America and what it means to be an American. Apple Pie on the Fourth of
July, Democracy, Freedom, Liberty, Justice for All.

But as we've seen that's more hypocrisy and lipstick on a pig. The virtues
extolled by the most patriotic lie in stark contrast to history and reality.

But there is still hope to be found in acknowledging the reality of our
circumstances.

I think we're in a barrel buddy.
