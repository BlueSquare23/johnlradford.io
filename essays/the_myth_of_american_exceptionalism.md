# Overview

Hey bud, just a heads up this one's going to be kinda sad.

Before we begin, let me say I don't hate America. I'm not trying to convince
you to hate America. America is and has always been an idea, a concept, a
dream, more than a reality. So what would that even mean to hate the concept of
America?

No, instead what I want to talk about today is dispelling the myth that America
is "the greatest country on Earth!" How we're going to do it is we're just
going to talk about facts and history.

See you and I went to the same schools, had the same history classes (shout out
Mr. O!). But as I'm sure you're very aware the traditional story we're told
about the founding and history of this country is a myth.

Likewise, so are many of the stories we're told about its values and greatest
beliefs.

## Part 1. America Exceptionalism By the Numbers 

By definition, to be _"exceptional"_ is to be out of the ordinary.

In stats we use a normal curve to describe how ordinary/exceptional something
is.

### Quality of Life Metrics

In political science they use what are called "Quality of Life" measures to
assess the health and well being of citizen in a given country. These include
things like, life expectancy, literacy rates, GDP per capita, real wage growth,
etc.

So just according to the numbers, how does America stack up against the rest of
the world?

### Literacy

To look at pure country ranking is misleading because literacy is a spectrum.
Its not a binary thing and is more complicated than simply can or cannot read. 

Also lots of countries lie about their overall literacy rates. On paper the US
has a 99% literacy rate, however that's misleading at best and an outright lie
at worse.

What's more important is the level people read at. This is tracked using a
standardized assessment developed by the _"Program for the International
Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC)"_. 

Here's some info I could find on actual US literacy rates.

[U.S. Department of Education NCES - July 2019](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019179/index.asp)

So how does this compare to other wealthy industrialized nations? 

Well I found this cool site that list all of these _Program for the
International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC)_ scores:

<iframe width='550' height='620' frameBorder='0' src='//www.compareyourcountry.org/adult-skills?cr=oecd&lg=en&page=0'></iframe>

Doesn't appear to be very exceptional to me. Looks kinda below average
actually, hrmmm...

### Infant Mortality

Well according the _CIA World Factbook_, the US is ranked 173rd out of 227
countries. Now in terms of infant mortality, higher ranking means less dead
babies. So no.1 is Afghanistan where on avg 100 / 1000 infants will die during
child birth. In the US that number is 5.1 / 1000 (with that number jumping to
10/1000 for African American women).

But still there are 50 countries on earth that do a better job taking care of
their babies than we do.

> Spending

### Cost of Living

Cost of living is ranked by something called the "Cost of Living Index."

> What Is a Cost of Living Index? 
>
> Cost of living data includes the expenses incurred for food, shelter,
> transportation, energy, clothing, education, healthcare, childcare, and
> entertainment.
>
> A cost of living index tracks how much basic expenses for these categories
> rise over time and in different regions. It can demonstrate how need-based
> expenses vary from one area to another. 

- [Cost of Living Index - investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100214/how-cost-living-index-calculated.asp)

What matters is a lower Cost of Living Index (COLI) number is better.

![US Cost of Living Map - numbeo.com](/static/img/us-cost-of-living.png)

- [Cost of Living Index by Country 2025 Mid-Year - numbeo.com](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp)

Now we have to keep in mind that the US is a developed nation and generally
speaking, developed nations have a higher cost of living.

However, surprise surprise, the US still ranks worse than Germany, France,
Japan, UK, Canada, Australia, etc.

But surely with all that money we're spending on it we're getting better
outcomes right?

### Gun Violence

- [Facts & Stats: How Much The U.S. Stands Out Globally](https://www.jacksoncountycombat.com/1112/Facts-Stats-How-Much-The-US-Stands-Out-G)

And firearms are now the leading cause of death for people age 1-19 in the US.
More than car crashes or cancer or anything else.

### These Are Choices

Now I'd disagree on one thing with Carl Sagan, "we" didn't do anything. I don't
believe the people have popular control over the government, so blaming
everyone collectively is not useful. Like "oh well guess we should all care
more," no that's not exactly the problem.

The problem is there are those who benefit from suffering through private
ownership. They have no incentive to change the status quo.

Instead we need to establish real popular control over the government with
robust mechanisms to keep private interests at bay.

## Part 2. History vs American Moral Superiority

Now you might be thinking;

"Well okay, maybe we're not the best at QoL metrics. Sure there's lots of
European and Asian countries that are beating us at reading, breading, and
feeding their populations. But they don't have the history and grandeur of the
United States! After all we're the world first and oldest Democracy. We're a
nation of immigrants with liberty, freedom, and justice for all! Right?"


## Part 3. American Culture

We're all aware of the sort of paradox of America's multi-cultural identity.
The best culture in the world, yet its just a recycling of every other culture.

The best food in the world! Except what's the most American food? A hotdog, a
_hamburg_er, _french_ fries. 

Well how about movies and entertainment?

You might notice not a single one of those is an original property or idea. The
only one on the list that's not explicitly a sequel is a movie based on a
plastic toy and sponsored by Matel. Yet they continue to make billions, so why
would they ever stop making them?

I wrote a custom perl script just to sort that data btw. All for you buddy!

## So What the Fuck is America Actually?

Okay this is the part where we get into more of Johnny's opinions on the
subject. But I'm not alone in thinking this way. 

The United States of America is an empire and an oligarchy. 

What you'll hear all over the news media is that with the rise of Trump, The US
has taken a hard right turn into fascism. And while its true that Trump is a
prototypical fascist, checking every single box perfectly, this administration
is simply a continuation of trends that have deep roots in American history.
